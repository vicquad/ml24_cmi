# Project for the course "Machine Learning"

## Description
This project is a part of the course "Machine Learning" at the University of Tartu. 
The goal of the project is to predict the level of problematic internet usage
among children and adolescents based on the given dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle competition "Child Mind Institute â€” Problematic Internet Use"
(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use/data).
